# CAN I WEAR SERVER W/ JAVA #
This is for learning purposes, we still keep using NodeJS and Express for Can I Wear project ðŸ˜¤. 

## What I Learn? ##
- OOP
- Class based languages
- Import, import and import (Which is actually good, because the app is very lean)
- IntelliJ IDEA is a very smart IDE (especially for JAVA, they provided a good of auto-generate file, variable, test, etc.)

## How to start ##
- ```git clone``` this repo
- open with any IDE you want (recommend IntelliJ IDEA), but you need to have JDK install in you machine.
- run the server (automatically on PORT 8080).
- enjoy!
